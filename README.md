# Prediction_of_CO2_car_emission

## Objectives
 * Use scikit-learn to implement simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression
 * Create a model, train,test and use the model to predict the CO2 Emission of a car
## Notes:
After trying different regression models we could see the Polynomial regression and the multiple regression predictive models showed the best accuracy.
